This repository uses IP files provided by Altera, controller interfaces written by a lot of different authors and there are sprites in PokéMIPS subfolder (an academic implementation of Pokémon FireRed running on a MIPS processor) that belongs to GameFreak and Nitendo. All this material was used only for academic purposes and their rights belongs to their authors.
